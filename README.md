This is my repo for BIOL 7863 Assignment 5. 

INSTRUCTIONS: 

1. First run "Update_GuestList.ipynb".  This is a Jupyter notebook that will create a text file "updated_guest_list.txt" in your current directory, which is the Part 3 of the assignment.  

2. Via command line, run:

> python3 Adamic_Assn5 guest_list.txt

> python3 Adamic_Assn5 updated_guest_list.txt

This will print the number of people who will eat turkey, and the amount of turkey needed (Parts 1 and 2 of the assignment), for both the original and the updated guest list.
