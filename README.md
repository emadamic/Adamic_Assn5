# Assn5
This is my repo for BIOL 7863 Assignment 5. It contains two Jupyter notebooks, and the necessary data files. 

1. "Update_GuestList.ipynb" will create a text file of the updated geust list (Part 3 of the assignment). 
2. "Adamic_Assn5.ipynb" is written via argument parisng and can be run via command line. It takes an input text file of the guest list and their food preferences, and will output the number of people who will eat turkey, and the amount of turkey needed (Parts 1 and 2 of the assignment).
