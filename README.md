# Assn5
This is my repo for BIOL 7863 Assignment 5. It contains two Jupyter notebooks, and the necessary data files. 

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN: 

1. "Update_GuestList.ipynb": Run this first, it will create a text file of the updated guest list (Part 3 of the assignment). 
2. "Adamic_Assn5.ipynb": Run this via command line, as it is written via argument parisng. The input file can be the original guest list, as well as the updated guest list created from the Update_GuestList.ipynb notebook.  It will output the number of people who will eat turkey, and the amount of turkey needed (Parts 1 and 2 of the assignment).
